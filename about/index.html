        <h1 id="title">about</h1>
        <p>Yo, I'm skrewde, programmer, gamer, relentless nerd. I'm currently pursuing a career in software engineering.
            this website is where i index my ideas into notes, posts, and <a href="../p">coding projects</a>.
            think of it as a public central repository for my brain. there isn't a lot of interesting facts about me
            (yet), but expect this section to fill pretty quickly as i go on my journey.</p>
        <h1 id="title">faq</h1>
        <p id="faq-subtitle">no one has asked these yet, but someone will in the near future</p>
        <h2>why 'skrewde'?</h2>
        <p>we've all had that moment where we get a new handle or username on a service only to find out someone more
            (or less) popular had it first. 'skrewde' is the fruit of my multi-year long foray into finding a unique
            name. since skweird & shroud (alongside thousands of sh- or sk- words) were taken, i had to get a little
            creative. it also rhymes with screwed which i thought was pretty funny (this is not a sex joke).</p>
        <h2>why programming/software engineering</h2>
        <p>the money. seriously though, computers have always been an obsession since i was little and i only found out
            i could make a career off them in my twenties.</p>
        <h2>hold on, how old are you?</h2>
        <p>twenty something.</p>
        <h2>why doesn't X feature or button on your site work?</h2>
        <p>my website is a work in progress. i decided to 'release' it rather than wait till it was all finished because
            i was itching to put stuff out again. also, as an aside, it pays to have a bias towards action as opposed to waiting for the perfect time. that said, if you encounter any bugs or accessibility issues, please reach out through <a href="../feedback">this</a> feedback form or shoot me an <a href="mailto:contact@skrewde.me">email</a>.</p>
